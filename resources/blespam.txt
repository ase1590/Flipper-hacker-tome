The BLE spam exists for official firmware in a GitHub repo, but keep in mind that:

1) You will need to look for it and compile it yourself.

2) The crash has been fixed, instead it's mostly an annoyance at this point with Bluetooth connection pop-ups. 

3) It can be considered an attempted Denial of Service (DoS) attack, so running it can get you in legal trouble. 

Illegal activities, even for "educational purposes," are not allowed to be discussed in the official firmware discord. Please do not ask us where to find it.
