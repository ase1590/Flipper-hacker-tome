People in tech circles & engineering in general appreciate curiosity and effort above all else. Asking a low effort question results in getting a low effort answer. You know what the lowest effort answer of all is? 
"Go google it and figure it out." So if you find that you get told to google it and figure it out a lot, maybe you should learn how to ask stronger questions.

Example:

Weak: Hey John, can I use python to do x?

Better: Hey John, I've got this python code, but it's doing y when I need it to do z. Any hints on what I'm doing wrong?

Strong: Hey John, I'm trying to accomplish xyz, using python. I've gotten x done, this is x. I've got this much done in y, but I'm struggling to connect it to z. How can I improve this and make it flow smoothly from x to y z?
