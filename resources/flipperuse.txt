Flipper is not a tool to be used illegally on items without permission.
It is first and foremost a tool to learn from and use to research.
Don't be yet another unoriginal burden on society by doing illegal things.
Instead, go out and get official permission from a local business to try things on their equipment.
Write up a neat little report for them on what you learned and what was exploitable.
Bonus points if you can give them recommendations on how to secure their systems for the future.
Flipper can be your path into the very beginnings of professional penetration testing.
Just make sure you get permission first!
