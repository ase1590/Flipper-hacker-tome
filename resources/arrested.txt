It is a FELONY in nearly ALL countries to attempt to mess with things you do not own. 
If you want to get arrested, then trying to use the Flipper on things you do not own is a EASY way to make that happen.
MANY people have gotten either kicked out of school over projectors, or threatened with lawsuits or legal accusations of computer hacking crimes.
Unless you are serious about ruining your future and ability to get jobs, consider NOT getting arrested!
